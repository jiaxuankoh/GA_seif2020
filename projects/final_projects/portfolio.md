# Portfolio Site

## WordPress

Create a site that shows off your work.  It should be created in Wordpress unless you get approval for something else by an instructor.  It is estsimated that 35% of the web is built with WordPress, so this is a great option for picking up freelance work for small local companies on your own, or even working as a Wordpress developer at a company.

There are multiple approaches you can take with this:

- Sign up for free at https://wordpress.com/.  You can pick a template, but you can't edit it.  If you sign up for premium you can edit CSS (not HTML) and add a custom domain
- Use https://www.000webhost.com/ or something similar to create a free wordpress site.  Here, not only can you choose a template, but you can also update its HTML and CSS.  You could even write your own template from scratch.  Custom domains might not be an option though.
- http://lunarpages.com/ and many other hosting companies allow you to create a wordpress site as well as a custom domain, but you have to pay for them.  Like with https://www.000webhost.com/, you have full control of HTML and CSS.  You can fiddle around with a pre-existing template or start from scratch.  You can also download and then upload the Wordpress files so you could work locally if you wanted to
- You can download the entire source code for Wordpress at https://wordpress.org/.  You can then work locally, using MAMP, and then upload the code to some other hosting company like Lunarpages, GoDaddy, etc.
