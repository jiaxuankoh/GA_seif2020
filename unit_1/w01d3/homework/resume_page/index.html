            <h2>RATS R PESTS</h2>
            <p>Adrenaline pumps in whenever I watch Tom and Jerry. I am extremely excited when Jerry gets caught by Tom but extremely frustrated when
               Jerry escapes (which he always does! ugh!) I sympathise with hoofman whenever they mourn over their food being ravaged by 
               these abominable creatures. They sneak in when nobody is around and take for themselves food which is great significances
               to hoofman. These poor hoofman worked so hard for the society and yet they have to endure the terror by these extremist acts. 
               They also faces the everyday fear of starvation. I have witness these poor conditions of hoofman and I have since put on the burden to 
               rid of these creatures. There is no room for hesitation. Whenever I have them, I will always look back at what I have been through to 
               remind myself that I would never want to see another hoofman starved because of these damnable rats. Never!
