During the last morning exercise, we built out the HTML for the VSSL mockup:

![vssl](vssl_mockup/mockup.png)

This morning, we're going to work on styling it with CSS to make it look more like the mockup.

## Setup

1. I have a sample_index.html in `warm_up_exercise/02/vssl_mockup/` folder that you can use.
2. Create your work in codepen.io

## Activity

1. Your focus should be on positioning the content!
1. Save looking for fonts for last. You don't need the exact font - just choose something that looks similar.

## Resources

If you struggled making the html, we've included an sample_index.html for you to work off of in the vssl_mockup folder.
