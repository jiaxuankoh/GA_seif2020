## Coder's Choice!

![that giphy of the angular thing](JovialSimilarAnchovy-size_restricted.gif)

For tonight's homework, **you and your partner** will choose what you would like to make for a MEAN CRUD app. Use everything that you've learned this week to write an API with CRUD routes and create an Angular front end that will interact with your data.

Start with a **single-model**! You'll only have the weekend to work on this. If you complete CRUD, feel free to make a second one but, check out the Hungry for More section for other ideas.

### Need some inspiration?

- bird sightings
- sausage app
- cars app
- creature / Gremlin cataloger
- travel tracker
- food cataloger
- book cataloger
- movie cataloger
- pet finder
- scientific data visualizer
- locations with lat and long
- recipe app
- fantasy football app
- journal
- blog
- wardrobe manager
- song app

Don't spend too much time thinking about the idea - just pick one and GO!

## Hungry for more

* Use `components` to split up your code

* Learn about `React.Fragment` and use one, if needed

* Use the [giphy API](https://api.giphy.com/) to add and remove gifs.

* Incorporate a 3rd Party API or another library like google maps or D3
